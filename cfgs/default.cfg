#####Mutation Parameters
#Chance of mutation, aka alpha
#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution
#4 is very conservative and works
#3 goes well for larger problems but sometimes is too much

####Fitness Type
#0 => We try to enforce validity by never making a possible bad placement. This also disables the penalty function.
