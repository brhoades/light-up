####Fitness Penalty Values
##Setting to 0 disables
# Bad light penalty
blight:.025
# Oversaturated Black Tile Penalty
osatb:.01
# Undersaturated Black Tile Penalty
usatb:.01

####Fitness Type
#0 => We try to enforce validity by never making a possible bad placement. This also disables the penalty function.
#1 => We take a penalty function hit when running and make mistakes anywhere we can.
