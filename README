This program has been throughly tested on Linux on both Python 3.2 and Python 3.3.

****It is known not to work on Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.****

Depending on your installation,you may need to install the configparser module for 
python. In Debian and Ubuntu, this package is named "python-configparser". 
Windows users may need to select this module during the installation of Python.

You may load any of the preconfigured problem sets with the -c command line option.
They can be found in the cfgs directory. The ones provided are the following:

default.cfg:
    Contains all necessary documentation on every different config option and what
    it does. Has a short sample run for debugging.
    
as1b-2.cfg:
    This satisifes the requirements of #2 of the third list in the assignment PDF.

as1b-3.cfg
    This duplicates the requirements by #3 of the third list in the assignment PDF.

Example:
    python3.3 main.py -c cfgs/default.cfg
