This program has been throughly tested on Linux on both Python 3.2 and Python 3.3.

You will require the pandas module for whichever version of python you attempt to run
this on.

****It is known not to work on Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.****

Depending on your installation,you may need to install the configparser module for 
python. In Debian and Ubuntu, this package is named "python-configparser". 
Windows users may need to select this module during the installation of Python.

You may load any of the preconfigured problem sets with the -c command line option.
They can be found in the cfgs directory.

Examples:

default.cfg:
    Contains all necessary documentation on every different config option and what
    it does. Has a short sample run for debugging.

Example:
    python3.3 main.py -c cfgs/default.cfg

Each config is named appropriately for the run they were used for.
